# Specification Quality Checklist: Hackathon II Phase I - In-Memory Todo Application (CLI)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

All checklist items have been validated successfully. The specification:
- Is written from user/business perspective with no implementation technology references
- Contains 30 detailed, testable functional requirements covering all user stories
- Includes 9 measurable success criteria that are technology-agnostic
- Defines 23 acceptance scenarios across 3 prioritized user stories
- Identifies 9 edge cases that need consideration
- Explicitly defines scope boundaries and non-goals
- Documents key assumptions that informed the specification

The specification is ready for the next phase: `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
